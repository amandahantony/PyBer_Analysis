# PyBer_Analysis
Creating a multi-line graph of ride-sharing data by city type. 

## Overview of Project 
### Purpose
In this new analysis, we compared the three city types(urban, suburban and rural) based on the total rides, total drivers and total fares in 2019. A more specified analysis was done on the total fares in each city type by date. Using Python plotting, a multi-line graph was created to show the total weekly fares for each city type between the months of January to April. This graph provides meaningful infomration that can be used to draw conclusions on city type trends, and weekly performance.

## Results 
1) A dataframe was created to compare the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and average fare per driver in each city type during the year of 2019 (shown below).
